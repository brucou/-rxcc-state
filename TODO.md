- package.json
- webpack config ?? the best I still have Rx, keep it for now
- contracts etc. ? remove dep. only used once!!
- isArrayUpdateOperations can be inlined : remove dep
- CONTRACT_MODEL_UPDATE_FN_RETURN_VALUE to inline too
- so only dep left is json patch

- at some point, write more serious tests
  - specially with hierarchical part
- at some point investigate MBT
- rollup ?? when I get read of Rx subject for pub/sub
